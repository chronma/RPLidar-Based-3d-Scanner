# Uses bits and pieces from the internet
# Python Script is for Python 3
# Changed to run on a Raspberry Pi by Tom Watts
# running the pylidaylibtest.py script a couple of times can reset the link to the rplidarmodule in the event the com link is left open
# ex. the script is aborted early.
# running the z axis test loop can help the stepper driver self tune (TMC2209) the 8825 drivers dont need this.
